About the Project

This simulation is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications by solving critical sustainability challenges. Participants work through different stages to create solutions for managing plastic waste in urban environments. The goal is to use AI, data science, and advocacy to promote recycling and waste management practices in communities.

The simulation involves three main stages:

    Data Science and Analytics: Analyze datasets to identify plastic waste hotspots and inefficiencies in recycling processes.
    AI Development: Design and implement an AI-based chatbot to guide urban communities in waste management and recycling.
    Advocacy: Contribute to a digital campaign aimed at educating and empowering communities to take action towards sustainability.

Project Stages

    Data Science and Analytics
        Analyze urban plastic waste data to identify key patterns and inefficiencies.
        Prepare and preprocess data for AI model development.

    AI Development
        Build an AI chatbot that provides guidance and actionable insights about waste management practices.
        Implement machine learning models to support the chatbot's functionality.

    Campaigning
        Develop a digital campaign to raise awareness about recycling and waste management.
        Utilize the AI chatbot to support the campaign’s outreach and effectiveness.
